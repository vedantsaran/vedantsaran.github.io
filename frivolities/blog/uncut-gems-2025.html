                <p>When I hit play on the Safdie brothers' <em>Uncut Gems</em> for the first time, I thought I was ready. I'd read the reviews that framed it as "anxiety-inducing" and praised Adam Sandler's once-in-a-career turn as Howard Ratner, a Diamond District jeweler and gambling addict forever one bet away from salvation, or ruin. The film inspires deep emotions in people; you either love it or hate it. From the opening synth-drone of Daniel Lopatin's score to the closing gunshot, the movie doesn't merely depict panic; it <em>performs</em> it on you.</p>
                <p><em>Uncut Gems</em> is perhaps the purest Rorschach test in recent cinema. Scroll the Google or Rotten Tomatoes user pages, and the split is almost comical, five-star raves stacked against one-star walkouts. Critics still hail its "master class of anxiety," while plenty of viewers swear they'll never endure those two hours again. The film's greatness is inseparable from that polarity; it forces you to decide whether you'll ride the chaos or eject. There's no middle ground, and that very division sharpens its edge.</p>
                <p>Part of the effect is structural. The Safdies layer simultaneous crises the way the late Dilla used to stack samples: from Howard's debts piling up to his precarious marriage, all while his ringtone refuses to shut up. The screen feels like a hostile ecosystem, a Manhattan that chews with its mouth open. Personally, it makes me reflect on how I skate to Howard's brand of self-inflicted combustion.</p>
                <p><em>Sandler</em> is the accelerant. A normally comedic actor, he somehow manages to blend charisma and self-harm. The way he cajoles Kevin Garnett with the mystical properties of a black opal one minute, sprinting down 47th Street with his cousins/loan sharks on his heels the next. Benjamin Lee for <em>The Guardian</em> nailed it: he "shines" because you truly believe Howard believes every lie he tells. I found myself half rooting for him, half praying he'd finally lose, just so the dread would stop. That's the emotional whiplash that makes people either permanently etch this movie on their Letterboxd favorites or swear it off forever.</p>
                <p>The film's enduring relevance, though, is the way its panic clarifies. In an age when algorithmic feeds promise aimless whimsy and distraction, <em>Uncut Gems</em> insists on friction. It drags me out of doom-scrolling and forces me to measure the odds I casually take with my own time and attention. The movie's greatest gift is the panic attack that wakes you up. Howard may be a gambler, but the greater gamble is ours: whether we absorb the lesson or, like him, double down on the next thrill.</p>
                <p>So yes, it still hurts to watch. That hurt is <em>exactly</em> why it's so good.</p>
